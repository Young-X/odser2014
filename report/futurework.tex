\section{Future Work}
For future work we recommend not to conduct more studies regarding outliers and outlier detection on already published studies. Instead, we propose that this should be done on to-be-published studies by journal and conference authors and reviewers through the use of mandatory outlier detection. For example, a journal could make it mandatory for all submitted papers to include information about how outliers were handled and ``did not handle outliers'' can not be an answer. This information would include information about the outlier detection method used, actions taken based on the result from the detection and motivations for the method used as well as the actions taken. The reason we propose to not conduct more studies on already published studies is that our results shows that it is difficult to obtain data from recently published studies. Hence, we assume that trying to get hold of data from older studies could be even more difficult.
